🛰️ Asteroid Risk & Orbit Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project presents a two-page interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze Near-Earth Asteroids (NEOs) using scientifically reliable orbital and physical data.
The dashboard emphasizes risk assessment, orbital behavior, proximity to Earth, and data reliability, going beyond simple visualization to provide structured analytical insights.

🎯 Objectives of the Project

The dashboard was developed to achieve the following objectives:

Identify Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)

Assess Earth proximity risk using Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID)

Analyze asteroid size and impact potential

Detect large but dim (hard-to-observe) asteroids

Study orbital characteristics such as eccentricity and inclination

Evaluate data reliability using RMS orbit uncertainty

Prioritize asteroids for scientific observation and monitoring

Enable object-level drill-down analysis for transparency and validation

📊 Dashboard Structure
🔹 Page 1: Risk & Overview Analysis

Focused on high-level monitoring and risk assessment.

Includes:

KPIs for total asteroids, NEOs, PHAs, largest diameter, closest MOID, and RMS error

Distribution analysis (NEO, PHA, size categories)

Scatter plot for hidden threat detection (size vs brightness)

Top 10 closest asteroids by MOID

Interactive drill-down table

Risk and reliability gauges

Purpose:
To provide a quick yet comprehensive understanding of asteroid risk and orbital characteristics.

🔹 Page 2: Research & Advanced Analysis

Focused on deep, research-oriented insights.

Includes:

Research KPIs (critical targets, high-uncertainty objects, close-approach candidates)

Distribution and ranking visuals for uncertainty and proximity

Observation-priority analysis

Advanced filtering for focused scientific exploration

Purpose:
To support research, prioritization, and further scientific investigation, separate from general monitoring.
